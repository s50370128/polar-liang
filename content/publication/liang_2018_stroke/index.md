abstract: The development of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality in recent years is opening doors for using VR, AR and MR devices in education. The purpose of this study was to test the use of augmented reality in teaching healthcare practitioners. To conduct our research, a simulation application was developed for the HoloLens that projects a face displaying facial drooping (a symptom of stroke) onto a training mannequin. Students at the nursing school were then placed in a clinical simulation wherein they wore the Microsoft HoloLens and performed an assessment of their mannequin patient. The students participated in a survey following their simulations and provided feedback on the devices and the quality of their experience. The results of the study show that most students enjoyed the simulation and felt that VR and AR will be a very useful educational tool in the near future. Further development of the program and device is underway, and future tests will be conducted. The results from this study will be helpful in further progressing the development of mixed reality, and the use of these devices in healthcare training.
