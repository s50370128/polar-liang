abstract: "A tower crane can be reduced the sway oscillation easily by controlling the rotation acceleration. with the proposed open-loop fast control method which is operated by controlling acceleration, the sway angle of suspended load can be maintained during the movement as well as reduced oscillation during and at the end of movement. In this paper, we design and produce a scaled tower crane with a servo control mechanism which can be used to control crane rotation precisely. Also, we do experiments with our scaled tower crane to validate the proposed fast control method. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of maintaining fixed angle during the movement and reducing oscillation."
