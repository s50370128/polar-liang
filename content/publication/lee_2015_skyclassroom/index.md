abstract: "Rapid changes in technology have made communication easier and more instantaneous in the twenty-first century. The ubiquity of Internet access has eliminated the barriers of region and time, thereby creating various opportunities for globalization. In the current study, the authors attempted to cultivate students in advance to make them competitive for the future. In 2014 and 2015, the authors participated in a global project-based course involving seven universities in five countries. This paper aims to document the experiences and reflections of students at National Taiwan University. The authors summarize the results in terms of five common phenomena, note five main problems with goals, technical issues, timing, skills, and team building, and report suggestions on communication, project process, tools, and techniques. Given the great amount of global cooperation in academia and business today, it is hoped that the findings of this report can assist people in global teamwork."
